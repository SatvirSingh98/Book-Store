For checking where to need testing we use 'coverage' package:-
pip install coverage
--> 'coverage run manage.py test' to run tests.
--> 'coverage report' will show what is behind the scenes.
--> "coverage run --omit='*/.venv/*' manage.py test" to exclude unnecessary files. And after this do report.
--> 'coverage html' will make 'htmlcov' folder and from there open index.html in browser.

We can also return just context in views.
To make a view accessible to every single page add it to context_processors in settings.py

To pre-populate any field in admin.py use 'pre-populate' field.
Install flake8-isort for sorting imports according to pep8.
Use it by typing 'isort .' in terminal.

How django works with sessions:
--> We start the browser, request the page from django and then it creates a new session.
--> That session data is stores in database as session_key, session_data and it's expiry_date.
--> Then django will return the requested page with session_key.
--> In frontend we store that session_key in a cookie.
--> By doing this, action performed by user to change it's data in frontend will also get changed in database.
    --> If user change the data, a request and session_key of that user is sent to django and the corresponding session_data is modified in database.
    --> Changes in the browser are reflected on page refresh and redirect.
    --> To prevent refreshing everytime we use AJAX.
 ```
 from django.contrib.sessions.models import Session
 s = Session.objects.get(pk='session_key')
 s.get_decoded()
 ```
