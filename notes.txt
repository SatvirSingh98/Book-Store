For checking where to need testing we use 'coverage' package:-
pip install coverage
--> 'coverage run manage.py test' to run tests.
--> 'coverage report' will show what is behind the scenes.
--> "coverage run --omit='*/.venv/*' manage.py test" to exclude unnecessary files. And after this do report.
--> 'coverage html' will make 'htmlcov' folder and from there open index.html in browser.

We can also return just context in views.
To make a view accessible to every single page add it to context_processors in settings.py

To pre-populate any field in admin.py use 'pre-populate' field.
Install flake8-isort for sorting imports according to pep8.
Use it by typing 'isort .' in terminal.
